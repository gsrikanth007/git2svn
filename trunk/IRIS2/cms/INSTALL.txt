IRIS II SilverStripe Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Installation prerequisites
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Before starting the installation process, it is assumed that your web
    environment meets the server requirements specified here:
    http://doc.silverstripe.org/server-requirements

    If you do not have all of the above software installed, please install them
    before continuing with this installation process.


1.  Checkout SilverStripe 2.4 release
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Checkout the latest stable SilverStripe release from:
    svn co http://svn.silverstripe.com/open/phpinstaller/branches/2.4/
    /path/to/irisii_cms


2.  Follow the SilverStripe installation process
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    After checking out a copy of the SilverStripe source code, follow the
    installation:
    http://doc.silverstripe.org/installation-on-webserver

    The directory structure should be as follows:
    /path/to/irisii_cms            << Installed in root of subdomain
        /irisii_app                << DQT application in root of subdomain
        /dqt -> /irisii_app/public << Symlink to public directory of irisii_app

    This structure will not require any links within the CMS to be updated.

    Please follow the DQT installation instructions for more information about
    how the Data Query Tool application should be configured.


3.  Install the Eionet SilverStripe theme and assets
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Checkout the themes/eionet directory to the themes directory of the
    SilverStripe installation using the following command:
    svn co https://svn.eionet.europa.eu/repositories/PHP/trunk/IRIS2/cms/themes/eionet
    /path/to/irisii_cms/themes/eionet

    Add the assets/downloads directory to the assets directory of the SilverStripe
    installation at the following path:
    /path/to/irisii_cms/assets/downloads

    Add the assets/images directory to the assets directory of the SilverStripe
    installation at the following path:
    /path/to/irisii_cms/assets/images


4.  Install the IRIS II CMS custom code
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    All code customisations made to a SilverStripe installation are contained
    within a single directory. This directory is called mysite by default,
    however it can be renamed if desired.

    Within the IRIS II CMS, the mysite directory has been renamed to irisii.
    Checkout the irisii directory to the root directory of the SilverStripe
    installation using the following command:
    svn co https://svn.eionet.europa.eu/repositories/PHP/trunk/IRIS2/cms/irisii
    /path/to/irisii_cms/irisii

    Within the mysite directory, the file _config.php stores the SilverStripe
    configuration options. Copy the database credentials from the
    mysite/_config.php file to irisii/_config.php and then proceed to delete the
    mysite directory using the following command:
    rm -rf /path/to/irisii_cms/mysite

    It is necessary to run a build before SilverStripe will acknowledge the
    addition of new custom code. This is achieved by appending /dev/build to the
    end of the URL. E.g.
    http://iris.eionet.europa.eu/dev/build

    This command requires an administrator to be logged into SilverStripe.


5.  Import the IRIS II CMS database.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The CMS database has not been added to SVN because the content will continue
    to change. A separate location to download the database will have been
    provided with these instructions.

    Import the CMS database schema and data using the following command:
    mysql -u irisii_cms_user -p <password> <dqt database> < rs_irisii_cms.sql

    At this point, the original CMS admin user will have been overwritten in the
    database. A default administrator account has been created within the
    database. The credentials for this account were included in with the database
    dump file.

    Re-run the /dev/build command used in step 5. E.g.
    http://iris.eionet.europa.eu/dev/build

    This command requires an administrator to be logged into SilverStripe.


6.  Open the CMS URL in a browser.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If everything has been completed, a page saying the following will be shown:
    "Home"

    If you are not getting the expected output, PHP errors can be enabled by
    appending ?isDev=1 to the end of the URL. E.g:
    http://iris.eionet.europa.eu/?isDev=1
