  * Due to a change in Google Map API, previous version of WMS does not
    longer work. A new library has been installed working with
    Google Maps >= v2.36:
    http://chignik.berkeley.edu/google/wms236.js.
    The library can be found in folder website/js/wms236.js and
    contains sample code too. Future updates may require replacing this
    file and test functionality (see below where);

  * Due to code duplication within the project, two new files were
    created: google.php and js/google.js. These have the purpose of unifying the
    calls to Google API across the project (mapit.php, dams.php and index.php)
    from a single place.
