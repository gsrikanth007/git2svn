                       README FOR EEA-DAMS PACKAGE

Dam exact position (expressed as geographical coordinates) is generally
unavailable.  A special process has been developed by the EEA (AIR3) to
locate as accurately as possible the dams listed in the Icold register on
large dams. This pre-location task is carried out by ETC/TE. The current
number of large dams is ~6000 in the EEA area.  Following agreement
with Icold, the national focal points of Icold will be requested to
accept / correct the proposed location. These organisations are based
in countries and know accurately where dams are, even though they do
not systematically have the coordinates at their disposal. To check /
correct the position, it has been considered that an Internet tool,
providing an image of the most likely position and a facility to fix a
new position by drag-and-drop a marker on the image would be the best
solution from the point of view of minimizing the burden, avoiding
copyright issues nevertheless ensuring security in transactions.

This arrangement follows the methodology of pre-positioning and
positioning dams developed by AIR3 and delivered to the ETC/TE that has
to carry out this work.

               HOW TO REPLICATE THE PROJECT ON DEVEL MACHINE

1. Have Apache 2.x + PHP 5.x + PostgreSQL 8.x on your machine

2. Create a virtual host on Apache server to point to website/ dir
        [cristiroma@localhost ~]$ cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/dampos.conf
        <VirtualHost 10.0.0.25:80>
            ServerName dampos.cristiroma
            ServerAdmin cristian.romanescu@eaudeweb.ro
            DocumentRoot /home/cristiroma/workspace/dampos/website
            ErrorLog logs/dampos.cristiroma-error_log
            CustomLog logs/dampos.cristiroma-access_log common
        </VirtualHost>
    and restart apache

3. Add obsoleted libraries to your php.ini.
      Dampos is using old libraries and installing via PEAR is a pain. Just:
    - connect to production machine and retrieve the contents of
      /usr/share/pear and add them to a local folder
      (ex. /home/cristiroma/tmp/pear)
    - edit php.ini and add this folder to include_path:
        ex. include_path = "... :/home/cristiroma/workspace/dampos.pear"

4. Handling database
    - Create a database named 'dampos'
    - export data from production
        as postgres user do: pg_dump EEADAMSDEMO > dampos.sql
    - import on your local file
        as postgres user do: cat dampos.sql | psql -d dampos

    - importing damsdb.pgsql might also work, haven't tested

5. Configuring the app
    - Make a copy of website/DataObjects/EEADAMS.ini or
      website/DataObjects/EEADAMSDEMO.ini and name it
      website/DataObjects/dampos.ini - note that "dampos" IS the same name as
      database name from PostgreSQL, sigh :^)

    - update website/DataObjects/config.ini to your local configuration,

    Example:
    database    = pgsql://postgres:@localhost/dampos
    schema_location = /home/cristiroma/workspace/dampos/website/DataObjects
    class_location  = /home/cristiroma/workspace/dampos/website/DataObjects
    require_prefix  = DataObjects/
    class_prefix    = DataObjects_

    Note: Apparently 'database' key has no effect - set from inc-config.conf

    - Edit website/commons/inc-config.conf to suit your local configuration
        [PATH] and [DB] sections.


6. Login from browser to http://dampos.cristiroma/loginpage.php?lang=en or
   whatever domain you have set in httpd.conf
    - If you forgot your username:
        [cristiroma@localhost dampos]$ md5sum
        new password CTRL+D
        6c652fbe608efb4e3844b50f75683de0  -
    - as postgres user:
        - psql -d dampos
        psql (8.4.9)
        Type "help" for help.
        dampos=# UPDATE users SET password='6c652fbe608efb4e3844b50f75683de0'
                 WHERE login='adminedw';

7. Trouble shooting
    a) I get "Fatal error:  Call to undefined method DB_Error::setLang() in
        /home/cristiroma/workspace/dampos/website/commons/config.php on line
        177"

        Check that the database information is correctly set in inc-config.conf

    b) I get "DB_DataObject Error: Unable to load schema for database and
        table (turn debugging up to 5 for full error message)"

        Check that you have correctly set the BASEDIR in inc-config.conf. Also
        it is important for BASEDIR to end with '/'.

        If this error persists, you can enable debugging by going to
        website/commons/config.php and add debugLevel(5):

        [cristiroma@localhost dampos]$ svn diff website/commons/config.php
        Index: website/commons/config.php
        ===================================================================
        --- website/commons/config.php    (revision 505)

            $do->whereAdd("PAGE_ID = '".$i18nPage."'");
